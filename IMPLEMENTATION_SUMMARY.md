- **Educational Branch**: Learning excellence with comprehensive security tutorials
- Complete quality gate definitions and promotion criteria

### **2. ✅ Advanced CI/CD Enhancement**

**Files**:

- [`.github/workflows/_reusable-production-check.yml`](.github/workflows/_reusable-production-check.yml)
- [`.github/workflows/ci-examples-enhanced.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-examples-enhanced.yml)
- [`.github/workflows/production-promotion.yml`](.github/workflows/production-promotion.yml)
- [`.github/workflows/quality-monitoring.yml`](.github/workflows/quality-monitoring.yml)

**Capabilities**:

- **Production Validation**: Comprehensive security, performance, and documentation validation
- **Branch-Aware Testing**: Automatic security level detection based on target branch
- **Automated Promotion Gates**: Multi-stage quality validation for main branch promotion

### **6. ✅ Enhanced Documentation**

**Files**: [`README.md`](README.md), [`NAVIGATION.md`](NAVIGATION.md)

**Updates**:

- Branch-based architecture explanation
- Clear quality level indicators
- Enhanced navigation with branch-first approach
- Professional credibility improvements
- AI-optimized structure maintained

## 🎯 Current Example Security Assessment

- ✅ No circuit breakers or placeholder security
- **Status**: Ready for main branch after documentation enhancement

### **🔧 Development Ready**

#### **nft-one-shot** - Grade: B (Good Foundation)

- ✅ Good security foundation (UTxO consumption validation)
- ✅ Proper one-shot minting enforcement
- ✅ Basic burn validation
- ⚠️ Limited features (no metadata validation, time windows)
- **Status**: Move to development branch for feature completion

### **📚 Educational Perfect**

#### **fungible-token** - Grade: F (Intentionally Educational)

- ❌ Placeholder security (returns `True`)
- ❌ No actual access control
- ✅ Circuit breaker prevents accidental deployment
- ✅ Clear educational value for demonstrating vulnerabilities
- **Status**: Transform into comprehensive educational resource

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps
