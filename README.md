Welcome to the AI-optimized knowledge base for the Aiken smart contract language on Cardano. This guide is designed for developers and AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot) to quickly find, understand, and implement Aiken smart contracts.

## Version Compatibility

**Aiken Version**: This guide is compatible with Aiken **v1.1.15+** (tested v1.1.15 & v1.1.19)  
**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Status**: 🚀 **ENHANCED ARCHITECTURE** - Branch-based quality separation implemented

## 🚀 **ENHANCED BRANCH ARCHITECTURE**

**This repository uses branch-based quality separation for maximum safety and clarity:**

### **📊 Branch Overview**

| Branch            | Purpose                    | Security Level     | Deployment Safety                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **`main`**        | 🚀 **Production Examples** | ✅ **Audited**     | **Safe for mainnet** (with review) |
| **`development`** | 🔧 **Work in Progress**    | ⚠️ **Functional**  | **Development only**               |
| **`educational`** | 📚 **Learning Content**    | ❌ **Educational** | **Never deploy**                   |

### **🎯 Quick Navigation**

- **Production Ready**: Use `main` branch for production deployments
- **Latest Features**: Check `development` branch for cutting-edge patterns
- **Security Learning**: Explore `educational` branch for vulnerability education

**➡️ See [BRANCH_STRATEGY.md](BRANCH_STRATEGY.md) for complete architecture details**

## Mission

This reference provides a comprehensive, structured, and easily searchable set of documents covering the Aiken language, from basic syntax to advanced security patterns. The content is optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure accurate and efficient code generation and problem-solving.

## 🚀 **Quick Deploy with Monitoring**

### **Deploy Changes with Real-Time Validation**

```bash
# Deploy with real-time CI/CD monitoring
git add .
git commit -m "feat: update Aiken documentation"
git push origin main

# Monitor deployment status (requires gh CLI)
gh run list --limit 5
gh run watch  # Real-time workflow monitoring

# Check specific workflow status
gh run list --workflow="CI – Examples" --limit 3
gh run list --workflow="CI – Core" --limit 3
```

### **Advanced Monitoring & Validation**

```bash
# Monitor all workflows simultaneously
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs --jq '.workflow_runs[] | select(.status=="in_progress") | {name: .name, status: .status}'

# Check deployment health across all examples
gh workflow list
gh run view --log  # View detailed logs for troubleshooting
```

## How to Use This Guide

### **Quick Start**

- **New to Aiken?** Start with [`QUICK_START.md`](QUICK_START.md) for a 5-minute setup guide
- **Need Navigation?** Use [`NAVIGATION.md`](NAVIGATION.md) to find exactly what you need

### **User Types**

- **AI Assistants**: Ingest the `docs/` directory to provide your language model with a deep understanding of Aiken. The modular structure allows for precise context-sourcing.
- **Developers**: Browse the `docs/` directory to find specific topics. Each file is self-contained but links to related concepts, allowing for easy navigation.
- **New Users**: Follow the user journey paths in [`NAVIGATION.md`](NAVIGATION.md) for guided learning
