## Mission

This reference provides a comprehensive, structured, and easily searchable set of documents covering the Aiken language, from basic syntax to advanced security patterns. The content is optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure accurate and efficient code generation and problem-solving.

## 🚀 **Quick Deploy with Monitoring**

### **Deploy Changes with Real-Time Validation**

```bash
# Deploy with real-time CI/CD monitoring
git add .
git commit -m "feat: update Aiken documentation"
git push origin main

# Monitor deployment status (requires gh CLI)
gh run list --limit 5
gh run watch  # Real-time workflow monitoring

# Check specific workflow status
gh run list --workflow="CI – Examples" --limit 3
gh run list --workflow="CI – Core" --limit 3
```

### **Advanced Monitoring & Validation**

```bash
# Monitor all workflows simultaneously
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs --jq '.workflow_runs[] | select(.status=="in_progress") | {name: .name, status: .status}'

# Check deployment health across all examples
gh workflow list
gh run view --log  # View detailed logs for troubleshooting
```

## How to Use This Guide

### **Quick Start**

- **New to Aiken?** Start with [`QUICK_START.md`](QUICK_START.md) for a 5-minute setup guide
- **Need Navigation?** Use [`NAVIGATION.md`](NAVIGATION.md) to find exactly what you need

### **User Types**

- **AI Assistants**: Ingest the `docs/` directory to provide your language model with a deep understanding of Aiken. The modular structure allows for precise context-sourcing.
- **Developers**: Browse the `docs/` directory to find specific topics. Each file is self-contained but links to related concepts, allowing for easy navigation.
- **New Users**: Follow the user journey paths in [`NAVIGATION.md`](NAVIGATION.md) for guided learning
